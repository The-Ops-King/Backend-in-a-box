# Engine — open questions

Ordered by how much downstream work they block.

---

## 1. Node type catalog (blocks the schema)
The set of node types is the engine's instruction set. Adding one later is easy; changing
what one *means* after runs exist is not. Current candidate set:

`wait` · `send_sms` · `send_email` · `check_condition` · `set_field` · `add_tag` ·
`remove_tag` · `move_stage` · `assign_owner` · `create_record` · `http_call` ·
`handoff_to_workflow` · `exit`

Open: is `handoff_to_workflow` a node or a trigger on the receiving workflow? A node is
simpler to read in the editor; a trigger keeps the coupling one-directional and lets the
receiving workflow change its entry conditions without the sender knowing. **Recommend
trigger** — the sender emits an event, the receiver decides whether to care.

## 2. Event bus shape (blocks triggers)
Triggers match on events. Where do events come from?
- GHL webhooks (appointments, payments, tags) — which ones are available, and which are
  only available on paid tiers?
- Our own forms (D8) — direct, trusted.
- Our own scheduler (time-based triggers, e.g. reactivation sweeps).

Open: one normalized `events` table everything writes to, or triggers matching against
source-specific tables? **Recommend one normalized table** — it's what makes the
"see it flowing" UI possible without a per-source special case, and it gives the
reconciliation sweep (D5) one place to look.

## 3. Condition expression format (blocks the editor)
`check_condition` needs a way to express "offer = pmu" or "total_collected >= contract_value"
that is both storable as data and editable in a visual node editor. Candidates:
- a small JSON predicate tree — safe, no eval, tedious to hand-write, trivial to render as UI
- a string DSL — pleasant to write, needs a parser, harder to render as nodes

**Recommend JSON predicate tree.** The editor is the authoring surface, so hand-writing
ergonomics don't matter, and it rules out code execution from a stored definition.

## 4. Scheduler cadence and the 300s function cap
Vercel Pro cron is 1-minute granularity; functions cap around 300s. A minute tick that
claims a batch of due runs and processes them is fine at this scale, but needs:
- row-level claim (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` or a `claimed_at` lease) so overlapping ticks
  can't process the same run twice
- a cap on batch size per tick, with the remainder picked up next tick
- a dead-letter path for a run that fails repeatedly, so one poisoned run can't stall a batch

Open: does the 1-minute floor satisfy speed-to-lead? A 60-second worst case on top of
webhook latency is probably fine for "minutes not hours," but it's worth stating as a
number in the client-facing scope rather than implying instant.

## 5. Credential handling after handoff
Unresolved from the earlier thread. If the client is on Hosted ($500/mo) and Tyler is no
longer managing, whose GHL token is in the `bindings` table, and who rotates it? A settings
screen in the dashboard is the rotation mechanism, but someone has to notice a token died.
Needs a health check per binding plus an alert to whoever holds the account.

## 6. Which GHL webhooks actually fire
Not yet verified. The send path is confirmed (`ghl/02-api-facts.md`); the inbound side isn't.
If appointment status changes don't produce a usable webhook, the no-show trigger falls back
to polling, which changes the latency story and the reconciliation design.
**This is the next thing worth testing against the live location.**
